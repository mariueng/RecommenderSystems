# tdt4215-22

Here you can find the detailed description of the group project requirements for TDT4215 Recommender Systems.

Original project authors are Lemei Zhang and Peng Liu.

Explicit Matrix Factorization implementation is based on the [blog](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2016/01/09/explicit-matrix-factorization-sgd-als/) by Ethan Rosenthal.

Start by looking at the **project_description.ipynb**, and then you can also take a look at the .py scripts if you're interested.

Good luck!

## Setup

To be able to use this project you need an environment supporting installment of the necessary python packages and jupyter notebook (kernels).
This can be done using pip, pipenv, conda, and jupyter notebook.

### Setup using Pipenv

To get started using pipenv you just have to install pipenv and run

`pipenv shell`

Ensure the correct interpreter is selected in your IDE and you should be ready to go.

NB! You might have to set a kernel for the jupyter notebooks as well manually.
