    "The goal of the student project is to apply the theoretical knowledge gained from lectures to solve a practical problem of building a recommender system for a newspaper website. Online news is one of the most important and popular ways for people to get informed every day. The task in this project is to filter the most useful and relevant news for a specific user. Students are expected to approach solving this problem through team work, experimentation, and analytical thinking within a limited time, adhering to a schedule outlined in a later section.\n",

Each student group will use the same dataset, collected from Adresseavisen portal, described in more detail below. Each group is free to choose their own tools and develop their own methods in order to get the best results. The only constraint is using the Adressa dataset."
